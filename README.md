# ChartLibrary
My small library for draw simple chart on java

For input and draw function use drawChart.inputFunction();

For draw line use class Line which accepts the arguments of our arrays and color lines.
For example:
  Line line = new Line(x, y, new Color(255, 0, 0));
  drawChart.draw(line);
  
You can draw several lines simply transferring them to the method drawChart.draw().
